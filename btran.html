            <p> 5/25 - Brandon has been demoted in rank several times but is overlooked for his knack for the game. As the combined leader in assists, Brandon has beautiful passes that can set up any player to rip the ball. His unpredictability leaves him a threat against any player in this draft. It is also known that he has severe commitment issues to his teammates and will only play for the Big Goomba. </p>
